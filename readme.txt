WordPlurk is a plugin that creates a complete integration between your WordPress blog and your Plurk account.

== Description ==

WordPlurk integrates with Plurk by giving you the following functionality of creating a post on Plurk whenever you post in your blog, with a link to the blog post.

== Installation ==

1. Download the plugin archive and expand it (you've likely already done this).
2. Upload the `wordplurk.php` file into your `wp-content/plugins/` directory.
3. Go to the Plugins page in your WordPress Administration area and click `Activate` beside `WordPlurk`.
4. Go to the WordPlurk Options page (Settings > WordPlurk) to set your Plurk username and password.

== Configuration ==

The available options are located at Settings > WordPlurk. This is where you set the username and password of the Plurk account you want updates posted to.

== Known Issues ==

* Only one Plurk account is supported (not one account per author).
* When a post is deleted, the Plurk update isn't.
* Plurk login details are not checked to see if they're correct.
